      geographicContext: 'Major urban centers across Australia (e.g., Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane), where gig economy food and parcel delivery is prevalent.',
      desiredOutcome: 'Improved financial security and workplace safety for delivery riders, and a fairer, more regulated gig economy sector nationwide.',

        priorBeliefs: 'Politicians: Some may view gig work as purely flexible entrepreneurship benefiting innovation, others as potentially exploitative. Consumers: May not fully consider rider conditions due to focus on service convenience, or may feel powerless to influence change.',
        mediaHabits: 'Politicians: Major national news outlets (ABC, Guardian, AFR), social media (Twitter/X for political discourse, LinkedIn), policy briefings, direct stakeholder meetings. Consumers: Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, news aggregators, recommendations from peers.'

      benchmarkData: 'Recent surveys indicate 35% of consumers are "very concerned" about gig worker conditions if made explicitly aware. Current estimated average hourly earnings for riders are $X after vehicle expenses, which is below the statutory minimum wage. Only Y% of the public are aware of any active campaigns for gig worker rights.'
